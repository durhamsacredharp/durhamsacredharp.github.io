                <p>Sacred Harp is an community folk hymn singing tradition from the United States. The Sacred Harp is also the
                    name of the book we sing from.</p>

                <p>We sing Sacred Harp in Durham every [dates/times TBC] at [location TBC].</p>

                <p>Come along! Our singings are open to all. We aren't a choir as we don't rehearse or perform and no-one's
                    in charge. Everyone just sings for their own enjoyment. You don't need to be able to read music yet or
                    have a "good" voice to come along.</p>

                <p>The words of most of the songs are from the Christian faith but singers of all religions and none are welcome.</p>
